      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here I have just attached the images of the flight fare prediction dashboard.It is a user interface that provides users with insights and information about the potential costs of air travel. 
        This type of dashboard utilizes data analysis, machine learning, and historical flight pricing information to offer users an estimate of how much they might need to pay for a specific flight route and date in the future.</p>
